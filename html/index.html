						<h2>History of tea</h2>
						<p>China is the home of tea, which is said to have started in the Shennong era, with a history
							of at
							least 4700 years. The tea sutra of Lu Yu, the tea sage of the Tang Dynasty, has had a
							profound
							influence on tea culture throughout history. Since then, the spirit of tea has permeated the
							court
							and society, penetrating into Chinese poetry, painting, calligraphy, religion and medicine.
							The
							following video can be used to enter a more in-depth understanding.</p>

						<p>The original intention of Time Tea House is not just to sell tea beverages alone, neither is
							it a
							service as people understand it. As a tea space it should be a culture, a traditional
							Chinese
							culture, such as the store's guqin, calligraphy and painting, bonsai, and porcelain, so that
							customers have an immersive experience. The moment you send tea into your mouth, Time Tea
							House
							allows you to isolate yourself from the hustle and bustle of the world and enter a unique
							oriental
							realm. In the end, welcome you to gather here with your family and friends to feel at ease!
